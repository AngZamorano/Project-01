Had a little system in place that checks if you visited certain places before to avoid repetive lines
Had a phone and coffe effect the story, by having the phone affect if you could enter the attic or not, and for the coffe it affects the ending if you have all 3 or not
The player can check how tired they're in certain rooms
If the player reached 120 sleep in the maze they would loop back to the dream bedroom, but if they made it out the maze, but didn't have enough coffe it would loop them back to the start of the game
Also  the sleep function affects if you can make it out the maze and changes the dialogue depending on how much sleep you have
Had a total of 30 knots I believe although some of them were dulicaptes I made, so I could send the player, so they didn't have to read the same descriptions over and over again
